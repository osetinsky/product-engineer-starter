## Plan:

### MBB:
- Suggest trying MBB to pinpoint pain-causing nerves. Involves anesthetic injection near key nerves. Risks explained.
- **RFA:** If MBB helps, think about RFA for longer relief. Will talk through risks.
- Continue NSAIDs and physical therapy.
- Follow-Up: Book a check-up post-MBB to decide next steps, possibly RFA.
